Operationalization is the process of publishing models and code as web services and the consumption of these services to produce business results.

Azure Machine Learning Operationalization is a component of the Azure CLI that enables operationalization of models that you create through Vienna that use the CNTK, SPARK, and Python machine learning platforms.
